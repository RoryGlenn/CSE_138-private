* *Team Contributions*: I worked by myself in this project
* *Acknowledgments:* I received help from Abhay Pande when accepting GET and POST requests when the command ping and echo were used.
* *Citations*: I used stackoverflow for getting the arguments that were passed into the echo function. Specifically, request.args.get('msg').
